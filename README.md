# Tableau Embed Samples

This repository contains JavaScript code samples that implement Tableau's Embedding API versions [2](https://help.tableau.com/current/api/js_api/en-us/JavaScriptAPI/js_api.htm) and [3](https://help.tableau.com/current/api/embedding_api/en-us/index.html).

Use these samples as a means to compare both versions of the Embedding API or to guide your own implementation. Projects using [version 3 of the API](https://help.tableau.com/current/api/embedding_api/en-us/index.html) are also called Connected Apps as they leverage the new SSO and integration [features provided by CA](https://help.tableau.com/current/online/en-us/connected_apps.htm).

To get started, navigate to the instructions provided by each project. The repository is split between v2 and v3 embeds.
